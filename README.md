# üíª Distributed Averaging System

## üëÄ About

Distributed Averaging System is app that operates in two modes: master and slave. The purpose of the application is to collect numerical data from various instances of the program and calculate the average of these numbers. The application uses the UDP communication protocol to transfer data between devices in the local network.

## üìã How the application works

### General

The application consists of, among others, a program implementing the DAS (Distributed Averaging
System) started with the command:
```bash
java DAS <port> <number>
```
where ```<port>``` is a number specifying the UDP port number and ```<number>``` is an integer.
The application works in two modes: master and slave. The mode selection is automatic
when the application is launched based on the current system state and the specified state
parameter. When launched, the application tries to create a UDP socket by opening a
UDP port with the number given by the ```<port>``` parameter. This operation can have two results:

- The application succeeds to open the requested port. This is where the app comes in
in master mode.
- The application fails to open the port because it is already occupied. It is assumed that
this situation can only occur when a given machine is already running
one instance of this application working in master mode. In this case, the application
starts working in slave mode.

### Master mode

Application working in master mode remembers value passed as the  ```<number>``` parameter
and then receives messages cyclically in a loop through the socket on port ```<port>```. Next application operations depends on value of the number received in the message:

- If this value is different than ```0``` and ```-1```, the process writes this value to the console and remembers it.
- If this value is ```0```, the process:
	*  Calculates the average value of all non-zero numbers received from start of work, including the ```<number>``` value.
	* Writes average value to the console.
	* Using the socket, on which it is working, it sends a broadcast message to all computers in its local network to port number ```<port>``` (the same one, on which it works on) containing the calculated average value.
- If this value is ```-1```, the process:
	* Writes this value to the console.
	* Using the socket, on which it is working, it sends a broadcast message to all computers in its local network to port number ```<port>``` (the same one, on which it works on) containing ```-1``` value.
	* Closes the socket and ends work.

### Slave mode

An application working in slave mode creates a UDP socket by opening a random UDP port
number (relying on the operating system in this respect) and then using
this socket, sends it to a process working on the same machine on port number
```<port>``` message containing the value of the ```<number>``` parameter. After doing this
the process terminates.
